        I believe I have completed most of the objectives to the
best of my abilities. I created a portfolio website to 
display some artwork for my industrial design roommate.
I have 5 .html files present in my folder. It has a 
main layout with a header of navlinks. The only file
that I could not figure out for small screen media
queries was my contact page. 
My contact page also contains forms. It also contains
my only animation that did not fit elsewhere.
There is a coherent flow
throughout all of the pages. Every image contains a
descriptive alt, and my files are organized into folders.
Each page includes its own favicon as well. Every .css and
.html file has been Nu Validated with no errors. Home
page has alignment on the center while the rest favor 
the left. HTTP link works on chrome but not Firefox which
I thought was a weird bug. There is a link to my roommates
art on instagram, and my page has consistent styling.
Text does not bleed on the edge with the use of divs.
